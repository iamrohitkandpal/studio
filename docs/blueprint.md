# **App Name**: Kandpal.me

## Core Features:

- Animated Background: Implement a full-screen HTML5 Canvas background with subtle animated starfield effects.
- Glass-morphism Panels: Design glass-morphism panels for each section (Header, Education, Experience, etc.) to present content in a visually appealing manner.
- Interactive Navigation: Implement a sticky top navigation bar with glass-morphism blur and smooth scrolling to different sections of the page.

## Style Guidelines:

- Use a dark-mode theme with a rich black background (#000) and subtle charcoal accents for a sophisticated look.
- Accent color: Teal (#008080) to provide a modern and tech-inspired highlight for interactive elements.
- Employ a full-screen layout with clearly defined sections within the glass-morphism panels.
- Implement subtle reveal effects such as fade-in and slide-up for each card as it enters the viewport to enhance user experience.
- Use glowing or bouncing effect for skill icons on hover to provide interactive feedback.
